### The name
* This project is named after hololive VTuber Mizumiya Su, whose
[karaoke stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTB0sPt8FFY) I was listening to
while thinking about what to name this project.

### [mizumiya.png](mizumiya.png)
* Main "logo"

### [mizumiya.xcf](mizumiya.xcf)
* GIMP 3 source for the logo. Also contains an alternative "pixel" logo, which
is just the "normal" logo, but with the lettering fitted to the light-blue pixel
background. I ended up thinking the current logo looks nicer.

### [ascii.txt](ascii.txt)
* This was originally intended to be the logo, but I couldn't get it to display
nicely anywhere except the terminal (it was too dependent on kerning/leading/
tracking of the environment). The similarity to PSHTML's logo is, surprisingly,
coincidental (despite this project being based off of it). Maybe I recalled it?
Either way, I at least use braces now, for the (intended) use of the
`-InnerHTML {...}` parameter (though it can, of course, take a string as
well...)
